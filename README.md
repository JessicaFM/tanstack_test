# React + TanStack Playground

This is a personal playground for experimenting with **React** and various **TanStack** libraries, including:

- [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) (implemented)
- [TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table/latest) (coming soon)
- [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest) (coming soon)

The goal of this project is to explore how these tools work together and get hands-on experience building small features and demos.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Notes
Currently, this project only includes a minimal setup with TanStack Query.

More experiments and components will be added progressively.

Just a testbed â€” nothing production-ready here ðŸš§
